feat: add init function that is called once when the Node is being registered

with this function, nodes have access to the RED global variable and can
use it to register other node-red resources, such as a new http admin route


static init(RED){
  RED.httpAdmin.get("/test", async function (req, res) {
      try {
        res.status(200).json({ message: "success" });
      } catch (err) {
        RED.log.error("ERROR:" + err.message);
        res.status(500).json({ message: "something unknown happened" });
      }
  });
}

This method is executed by the mixin, and runs only once
